    <h2>About me</h2>
    <article>
      <p><h3>I am from Mexico. I come to Ottawa with my housband and two children. They are 10 and 13 years old.<br>
        I have been in Ottawa since August 21<sup>th.</sup><br>
        I have <em>never</em> been here before. But my housband came here many years ago and he fell inlove with Canada.<br>
        Now, as a family, we are enjoying it. </p><br>
        <p>Ottawa is wonderful, I love its nature also its several rivers that you can find here.<br>
        I believe it is peaceful place.
     <STRONG>Although it is not easy to leave your country</STRONG><br>
     it is something worthwhile for my family and to me.</h3></p>
